## Hippopotamission

Hi there! As per "end of week 3" tradition, the front end engineering class at The Iron Yard DC collaborated on building a version simple in-browser game to bring together all of the elements we've learned so far.

In this cohort, we decided to make kind of an "evasion" game -- you need to move your cursor as far as possible away from the baddies. In a unique twist, there are objects you need to collect while evading the baddies; collecting an object removes one of the baddies and spawns another collectible at a random location. Removing all the baddies in a level advances you to the next, where there's more, faster hippos, etc.

The backstory for this game is such: you're a marble in the middle of the ocean (hence the beach ball cursor in-game). There are a lot of hungry hippos that are swarming around, looking for marbles and marble-like objects to consume. You need to defeat them by swimming into an oyster. How a marble entering an oyster controls the population of an invasive hippopotamus species is not clearly defined.

My students though it was funny to compel me to make the art for this game, so enjoy your Lovecraftian nightmare spider-hippos and an oyster that looks like buttered toast.

A live version of this code probably lives at [https://hippogame.herokuapp.com](https://hippogame.herokuapp.com).
